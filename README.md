# Automated GitHub Project Setup Script

This powerful Python script automates the process of setting up a new GitHub repository, making it easier than ever to start a new coding project. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this tool streamlines your workflow by handling repository creation, Git initialization, and initial commits all in one go.

## Features

- üöÄ Automatically creates a new private GitHub repository
- üîß Initializes Git locally and sets up remote origin
- üìù Downloads language-specific `.gitignore` files (Python or Node.js)
- üîí Securely handles GitHub authentication using personal access tokens
- üßπ Option to clean existing Git files for a fresh start
- ‚úèÔ∏è Allows adding custom entries to `.gitignore`
- üîÑ Performs initial commit and push to the new repository

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)

## Quick Start

To get started with the GitHub Project Setup Script, follow these steps:

1. Download the script using `wget`:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/your-repo-name/main/github_setup.py
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script with the following content:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here
GITHUB_EMAIL=your_github_email@example.com
```

Replace `your_personal_access_token_here` with your GitHub personal access token and `your_github_email@example.com` with your GitHub email address.

4. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x github_setup.py
```

5. Run the script:

```bash
./github_setup.py
```

## Usage

When you run the script, it will guide you through the following steps:

1. If an existing Git repository is detected, it will ask if you want to delete it and start fresh.
2. You'll be prompted to choose the project language (Python or Node.js).
3. The script will download the appropriate `.gitignore` file for your chosen language.
4. You'll have the option to add custom lines to the `.gitignore` file.
5. You'll be asked to enter a name for your new GitHub repository.
6. The script will create the repository, initialize Git, and push the initial commit.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure your GitHub token has the necessary permissions to create repositories.
- Check that your `.env` file is in the correct location and contains the right information.
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection.
